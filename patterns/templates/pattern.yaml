# Pattern Template
# Use this template when manually adding patterns to patterns.yaml

# For a pattern (something to do):
pattern:
  id: "pat-XXXXXX-XXXX"           # Generated automatically by CLI
  name: "Pattern name"            # Short, descriptive name
  context: "When this applies"    # Situation where pattern is relevant
  problem: "What goes wrong"      # The problem this pattern solves
  solution: "How to fix it"       # The recommended approach
  category: "bash"                # One of: bash, git, testing, architecture, naming, security, docker, api, performance, general
  origin: "session-YYYY-MM-DD"    # Where this was learned
  confidence: 0.5                 # 0.0 to 1.0, increases with validation
  validations: 0                  # Number of times validated
  created_at: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
  examples:                       # Optional examples
    - bad: "code that's problematic"
    - good: "code that's better"

# For an anti-pattern (something to avoid):
anti_pattern:
  id: "anti-XXXXXX-XXXX"          # Generated automatically by CLI
  name: "Anti-pattern name"       # Short, descriptive name
  symptom: "What you observe"     # How to recognize this anti-pattern
  risk: "Why it's bad"            # Consequences of this anti-pattern
  fix: "How to fix it"            # The recommended solution
  category: "security"            # Same categories as patterns
  severity: "medium"              # One of: low, medium, high, critical
  created_at: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"

# Example pattern entry:
# - id: "pat-123456-abcd"
#   name: "Safe bash arithmetic"
#   context: "Incrementing variables in bash with set -e"
#   problem: "((x++)) returns exit code 1 when x is 0"
#   solution: "Use x=$((x + 1)) instead"
#   category: "bash"
#   origin: "session-2026-02-09"
#   confidence: 0.9
#   validations: 5
#   created_at: "2026-02-09T12:00:00Z"
#   examples:
#     - bad: "((count++))"
#     - good: "count=$((count + 1))"
