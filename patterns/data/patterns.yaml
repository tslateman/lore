      context: "When documentation or planning names an architecture (e.g., 'task execution stack', 'orchestration layer') and the name will drive decisions about scope, ownership, or archival"
      problem: "Aspirational names obscure what code actually does. Flow+Bach were called a 'task execution' system — neither executed anything. The mismatch caused misplaced ownership, redundant tooling discussions, and delayed archival."
      solution: "Read the actual skill files, commands, and source before accepting the framing. Ask: what does this code literally do? Match the name to the behavior, not to the intent. Cross-reference Lore decisions and ecosystem ADRs for wider context. Rename or correct the framing before it calcifies into more docs."

      problem: "How to integrate AI coding agents with a persistent memory/context system without tight coupling"
      solution: "Separate concerns into two layers: (1) Memory layer owns intent, decisions, patterns, failures — the *what* and *why*; (2) Execution layer owns task breakdown and implementation — the *how* and *when*. Connect them via spec files that serve as contracts. Specs include: goal, success_criteria, context (decisions, risks), done_when conditions. Memory layer exposes MCP tools for reading context; execution layer consumes specs and reports outcomes back."

      solution: "Build prototype to validate design intent. Decompose into plan files targeting existing repos — each plan references prototype code by file and line for design intent, implements in target repo's conventions. Prototype dissolves after plans execute. Key: plan files gate dependencies (Lineage inbox before Neo sync), include What NOT to Do sections to prevent scope creep, and explicitly forbid copying the prototype's technology choices."
