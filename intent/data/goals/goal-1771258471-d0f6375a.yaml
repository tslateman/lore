name: "Integrate Entire CLI for checkpoints and session capture"
description: |
  Adopt Entire CLI (github.com/entireio/cli) for checkpoint/rollback capabilities.
  Integrate with Geordi for observability and Lore for memory persistence.
  
  Three phases:
  1. Geordi reads Entire checkpoint branch for unified session view
  2. Entire checkpoints flow to Lore journal via yeoman bridge
  3. Lore patterns inject into Entire resume for context continuity
