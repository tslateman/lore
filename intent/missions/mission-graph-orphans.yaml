title: Resolve orphan nodes in knowledge graph
objective: >
  Connect the 48 orphan nodes (nodes with zero edges) in graph/data/graph.json
  to their related concepts. Done when orphan count drops below 10.
project: lore
domain: knowledge-graph
constraints:
  - Preserve existing edges — add only, never remove
  - Each new edge must have a meaningful relation type
  - Prefer derives_from and relates_to for weak connections
success_criteria:
  - criterion: Orphan node count below 10
    verification: "Run: graph/graph.sh orphans | wc -l"
  - criterion: No invalid edges introduced
    verification: "Run: graph/graph.sh validate"
